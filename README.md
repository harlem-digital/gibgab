##Chat

Chat is the core of the GibGab application. It is the way all internal teams communicate with one another.

* **Direct Messages:** A user can direct message another in-network user or group of in-network users.
* **Channels:** Channels are a way for a group of users to communicate on a topic or project.
* **Search:** Search makes sifting through messages and channels easily.

##Email

While using GibGab's chat functionality will cut down on usage of email, there unfortunately isn't a way for **everyone** to avoid the use of email. As some employees will need to be communicating with outside vendors, clients, etc. So we try to incorporate email in a way that feels just like Chat.

* **Subjects:** Describe the contents of the message
* **Design:** The Email will have the exact look and feel of a Chat, except for the subject will always be prominent.

##Fax

GibGab's users will have the ability to send and recieve faxes, fax messages will display inline along with voicemail and chat

## Voice

* **Calling:** A user can make a free call to another in-network user or group of in-network users.
* **Call Forwarding:** A user can have calls forwarded to voicemail or another number.
* **Voicemail Transcription:** A user can view a transcribed copy of their voicemails.
